## Description

MASS1 is a one-dimensional unsteady hydrodynamic and water quality
model capable of simulating open channel flows, water surface
elevations, dissolved gas, and water temperature. The model is
applicable to any branched channel system. Because MASS1 uses
cross-section averaging, only single values of water surface
elevation, velocity, discharge, and temperature are produced at each
cross-section location along the river course. Lateral (i.e., across
the river channel) and vertical variations of these quantities are not
simulated.  

MASS1 was developed by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
(PNNL). It is a research code, written for applications and computer
platforms specific to the developers.  Others may, or may not,
find it useful.  

## Obtaining the Code

The MASS1 source code is currently hosted on PNNL's internal Git
repository.  MASS1 shares some code with other applications, which is
included in MASS1 as a Git sub-module.  Do the following to check out
the code:

```
git clone https://stash.pnnl.gov/scm/~d3g096/mass1.git
cd mass1
git submodule update --init
```

## Requirements

MASS1 has been used primarily on UNIX, Linux, and Mac OS X
systems. The following describes how to build MASS1 on those
platforms.  It has been built and used on Windows systems, but rarely.
The following should work on Windows if [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com/)
or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) is utilized.  A native Windows build
may be available in the future. 

### Fortran 2003 compiler

MASS1 is written in Fortran and makes use of several
[Fortran 2003](http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Fortran+2003)
constructs.  Consistently, a Fortran compiler that conforms to the
2003 standard is required to build MASS1. The following compilers are
known to work:

* [GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/), Version 4.8 or higher

* [Intel Fortran](https://software.intel.com/en-us/fortran-compilers),
  Version 18 or higher 

In general, the Intel compiler produces a faster executable, but for
most applications, this is not noticable. In the past, Fortran
compilers from [NAG](https://www.nag.com/nag-compiler),
[Absoft](https://www.absoft.com/),
[IBM](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/xlfortran-linux), and
others have worked.  

## Optional Software

### Gnuplot

[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is used to plot MASS1 test
results.  If [Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/) is not found on the
system, tests can still be run, but the results will not be plotted.  

### Perl

Several optional [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) pre/post-processing
scripts are provided.  These use the following
[Perl](https://www.perl.org/) modules:

* `Date::Manip`

* `PDL`

* `PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Window`

When MASS1 code is configured, the system's
[Perl](https://www.perl.org/) installation is queried to see if the
scripts can be used. If not, the scripts are not configured or
installed.  

### Python

In addition to the Perl scripts, some optional
[Python](https://www.python.org/) pre/post-processing scripts are also
provided.  

### R

There is an optional [R](https://www.r-project.org/) script for
reading MASS1 time series output and boundary condition files. 

### Tecplot

[Tecplot](https://www.tecplot.com/) is a commercial visualization
software package.  There is a script to build
[Tecplot](https://www.tecplot.com/) input files from MASS1 profile
output. It is used to make some profile animations in a few
test cases. It's use is optional.  

## Configure and Build

MASS1 uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) cross-platform tools to
configure and build MASS1.  CMake queries  the system
and determine if the compiler has sufficient capability to compile
MASS1 and if optional software is available.  

A typical configuration:

1. In the top MASS1 source directory (where `CMakeLists.txt` is
   located), make a directory for the build, called `build` maybe, and
   change into that directory.
   
2. If necessary, choose the Fortran compiler to use by setting `FC`
   and `FCFLAGS` environment variables. For example, 

```
mkdir build
cd build
FC=gfortran
export FC
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ..
```

## Usage

MASS1 is a *command line* application. There is no graphical user
interface.  All [input and output](doc/README.md) are plain text files
(except hotstart files). There is very little
[documentation](doc/README.md), other than the
code itself.  

The first step in a MASS1 application is to define the topology of the
river system to be simulated. The topological definition defines how
the channel system is connected as well as the location and type of
hydraulic control structures. The domain into a set of *links*, each
representing a single river reach. The ends of each link either
represent a boundary, at which river conditions are specified, or
connect to one or more other links. Each link is further divided into
series of computational points, where the hydrodynamic and transport
equations are discretized.  


When run, MASS1 expects to find a
[configuration file](doc/configuration.md) named `mass1.cfg`.
